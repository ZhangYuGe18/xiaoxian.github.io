Xiaoxian (Shawn) Zhang is currently a Clinical Medical Physicist at the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University. He graduated from the National University of Singapore(NUS), where he was advised by Dr. Lei Li at the Digital Heart Lab. Previously, he served as a Data Scientist at Urban Quadrant (Beijing Community Research Center). Leveraging a strong technical foundation in visual perception, semantic analysis, and knowledge reasoning, Xiaoxian is capable of integrating heterogeneous algorithm modules into engineering solutions to solve complex problems.

我目前是西安交通大学医学部（第一附属医院）的临床医学物理师，毕业于新加坡国立大学，导师是Digital Heart lab的Lei Li，此前，曾任职于城市象限（北京社区研究中心）数据科学家。拥有横跨视觉感知、语义分析与知识推理多个维度的技术背景，能够将异构的算法模块整合为可解决复杂问题的程解决方案。
人工智能（AI）技术的不断迭代，正在重塑我们对于现实世界的理解范式。从城市建成空间到医学物理，AI为更多领域的探索提供了可能。作为一个跨学科研究者，他的研究兴趣是挖掘AI算法在广泛定义的“健康空间”中的量化建模潜力，致力于将数据智能，应用于解决肿瘤放射治疗与健康城市治理中的复杂问题。。

**AI for Radiotherapy**: The continuous iteration of AI technology is reshaping the paradigms of how we understand the real world. From urban built environments to medical physics, AI opens up new possibilities for exploration. As an interdisciplinary researcher, he focuses on exploring the potential of AI algorithms for quantitative modeling within "Health Spaces." His work is dedicated to applying Data Intelligence to address critical issues in radiation oncology and healthy city governance.

- **AI for STAR (Stereotactic Arrhythmia Radioablation)**: The use of stereotactic radiotherapy for refractory arrhythmias (such as Ventricular Tachycardia) represents a cutting-edge, non-oncological frontier in the field. This direction faces significant technical barriers, as the heart is a constantly beating organ, and the arrhythmogenic substrate is often difficult to identify visually through a single imaging modality.

- **Healthy Cities**: Distinct from public health research, which typically focuses on infectious or chronic diseases per se, Xiaoxian’s work emphasizes how the Built Environment shapes health risk structures. He specifically utilizes AI and multi-source heterogeneous data to model the correlation between physical spaces and resident health, providing data-driven spatial optimization strategies for urban renewal.
