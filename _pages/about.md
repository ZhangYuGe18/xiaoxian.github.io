Welcome to my personal website! This site showcases my academic work, projects, and updates.

This website is built using Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. The content is organized into several sections:

- **Publications**: My research publications and papers
- **Projects**: My projects and work
- **News**: Updates and news about my work
- **CV**: My curriculum vitae

For those who need advanced functionality, the site supports:
- [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for mathematical equations
- [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) for diagraming
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/) for plotting
